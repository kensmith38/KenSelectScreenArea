# KenSelectScreenArea
Select area of screen (tool for other projects).  
There are two projects (Base and Test) in this VisualStudio 2019 solution.  The Test project shows how the Base can be used to select
an area of the Windows screen.  The Base will be utilized by other projects which need the user to select a portion of the screen for
purposes such as taking a snapshot of that portion of the screen.
